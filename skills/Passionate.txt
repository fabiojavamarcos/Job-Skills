Passionate: According to the employee work passion theory,
work passion arises when the employee repeatedly interpret
their work environment positively, leading them to feel good
emotionally, find their work meaningful, and wanting to act in
ways that help the organization (e.g., performing well, staying,
endorsing it) [22]. P7 emphasized the importance of having
passion as he would “lower a little bit the requirements and
focus more into their passions. Potentially more than *** higher
educational requirements, for example.” As P9 stated: “I want
to have a candidate work on my team who is when they wake
up in the morning, they’re excited to come to work and tackle
exciting challenges that we’re trying to solve. I don’t want
someone to wake up in the morning and be like, oh, I got to
go to work again. That’s not a fun person to work with.

Communicative candidates, or those who listen actively,
express ideas clearly, and adapt to their audience, are highly val-
ued by the managers in our sample. P2 emphasized emotional
intelligence, noting strong candidates “listened and asked good
critical probing questions” and showed “a degree of clarity”
in their responses. P3 stressed that effective communicators
must also “read the audience” to gauge whether their message
is landing. For software engineering roles, the ability to clearly
explain technical concepts is especially critical. As P5 put it,
candidates must be “able to articulate something technical or
able to convey an idea or an architecture in simple terms that
can be consumed.” P10 echoed this need, explaining that it is
“very valuable in our teams as software engineers because at
some point, they’re going to do a presentation on their project,
a design review, and you have to be able to read the room
and describe things from a technical nature in a way that your
audience can understand it.”

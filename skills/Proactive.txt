Proactive: Our participants expect early-career workers to
demonstrate taking “initiative” (P2, P4), which is “hard to find
during an interview”. P3 explained this initiative as being a
“self starter” and illustrated it with a real situation: “I’m going
to be able to give them an assignment and then I’m not going
to have to observe them. I’m going to check in with them, but
they’re going to go and figure out how to get started.” Since
the question focused on early-career workers, P3 clarified they
were “not suggesting to just throw them in the deep end of
the pool” but rather emphasized the importance of “getting
them peers that they can reference” and “giving them a work
item — they’re going to pick up that work item”. P3 further
explained that initiative is not just about being assigned a task,
but about actively seeking one.

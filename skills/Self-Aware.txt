Self-Aware emerged as a critical expectation from managers
evaluating early-career candidates, particularly for roles that
demand both technical competence and interpersonal adapt-
ability. P2 explained that self-awareness includes “an ability
of self regulation,” especially under pressure, observing how
candidates respond emotionally when “the pressure is on.”
Emotional intelligence was frequently mentioned as a related
trait. P2 described it as the ability to “step outside yourself
to look at the situation with a different set of eyes,” and to
seek feedback and advice. This capacity for reflection and
growth is what P2 called a sign of “good emotional maturity,”
emphasizing that while perfection isn’t expected, “you can’t
be oblivious either.” P4 reinforced this idea, describing self-
awareness as understanding both oneself and others: “it’s
about them understanding themselves and those around them.”
P3 similarly stressed the importance of recognizing personal
limits, stating, “you have to know your limitations.” P6 added
a nuanced dimension, focusing on resilience in the face of
uncertainty: “the gap between I don’t know something and
I know something,” and whether candidates can “sit in that
in between and feel the frustration” without giving up. P10
even used candidates’ demeanor in interviews to assess fit,
noting that if someone “can’t relax... they’re probably ‘wired
pretty tight,’” which may or may not align with the team’s
needs when working under pressure for a software delivery.
Finally, P12 summed it up as “understanding yourself and
how you’ll best work,” including recognizing priorities such
as the “difference between urgency and importance.”

Adaptable skill definition: Our participants emphasized that early career CS
candidates must be able to adapt to unexpected problems and
changes (P5, P9). Not just adapt, but “adapt quickly” (P9), and
then “pivot and engage” (P5). This is essential because, as P9
explained, “tools and methodologies change very frequently, so
being adaptable and flexible is really important”. P5 illustrated
a scenario where adaptability is critical: “You’re executing
the strategy. That’s undefined, and so that first part of it is
developing a strategy and scoping the change that you need
to make, and then figuring out the systems and measures that
need to be in place in order to adapt that change.”

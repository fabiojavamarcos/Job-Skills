Collaborative is a characteristic that includes being a team
player and willing to work with others [ 4 ]. Managers expect
entry-level candidates to demonstrate the ability to engage
in team environments, with several calling teamwork a key
hiring criterion. P8 emphasized, “teamwork is my number one
thing” and “teamwork is the deal breaker.” P1 reinforced its
importance, explaining that “working with a team... is when we
get the best solutions” due to diverse perspectives, yet noted
that many candidates lack this experience because “so much of
the emphasis is on doing your own work.” Still, P1 saw it as
“a skill that people can learn,” and focused interview questions
on past team projects. P3 observed candidates’ interaction with
teams to assess how well they “mesh with the team,” while P9
clearly stated, “there is no lone wolf work here.” Although P7
admitted collaboration “is very, very hard,” it remains critical,
especially in customer-facing and cross-functional projects. As
P12 summarized, managers need to know “how do they behave
in a team or do they thrive in the team environment,” even if
these behaviors are hard to assess.

Courageous candidates—those willing to take risks, admit
what they don’t know, and engage openly—are highly valued
by managers hiring early-career engineers. P5 highlighted that
“courage to be vulnerable” is a key differentiator, noting that
early-career professionals often struggle because “they’re not
sure of themselves or they are oversure of themselves. And
in both scenarios, the outcome results in hiding, citing things
you don’t know.” Managers emphasized that true growth in
technical roles requires the bravery to confront uncertainty and
failure. As P5 put it, “you don’t get good at something hard
without courage.” This is particularly relevant in fast-paced
engineering environments where learning is continuous and
errors are part of the process. P10 echoed this, noting that
junior developers need “the courage to ask questions that might
expose you to something that you need to learn,” and that “it
takes courage to ask questions and then be wrong.” Together,
these insights show that courage is not just about boldness but
about embracing the discomfort of learning and improving in
technical and collaborative settings.

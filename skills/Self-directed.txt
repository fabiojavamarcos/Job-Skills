Self-directed: Managers expect a candidate to have self-
motivation (P1,P11,P12), not just the extrinsic motivation, but
the “intrinsic motivation, or what gets them up in the morning”
(P2). Besides taking the initiative to work on a task, having
also initiative to learn (P5,P9). P9 described an example of
initiative as learning a new tool by running it after reading the
documentation, and remembered about a candidate that learned
about a tool being used by HPE and was “willing to learn it”,
so the candidate was “demonstrating that even though [they]
didn’t know about this big thing that [HPE] uses, they went
and learned about it. And [HPE] ultimately hired that person.”

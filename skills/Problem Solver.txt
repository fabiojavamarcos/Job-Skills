Problem Solvers are expected to not only apply technical
knowledge but also demonstrate adaptability and analytical
thinking when tackling problems. Managers emphasized that
candidates must show a “problem solving mentality” (P1), an
ability to “solve problems with a team”, “know how to solve
problems with code.” Several managers described problem
solving as both a mindset and a structured process. P7 valued
candidates who could “break down a problem in a micro
algorithmic way”, “partitioning complex problems into small
problems.” P10 similarly explained that good problem solvers
“break it down in your own brain and then apply some computer
science concept to be able to solve it.” In practical team settings,
P7 noted that early-career developers are often “trying to solve
a real life problem for a particular business,” where context and
collaboration matter. P5 stressed the importance of process,
asking candidates “how do [they] approach a problem for
which there is no solution” and whether they can “convey a
technical problem in a way that somebody can engage and work
with [them].” Resilience and flexibility also matter. P9 pointed
out that candidates should know how to handle “unexpected
problems, whether a bug in their code or there was a global
pandemic.”

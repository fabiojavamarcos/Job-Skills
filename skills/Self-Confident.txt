Self-Confident: Managers highlighted self-confidence as a
critical attribute for entry-level candidates, often linking it to the
ability to navigate ambiguity and take initiative. P3 described
self-confidence as being “comfortable communicating their
ideas,” while P2 emphasized the importance of having “self-
confidence on trying things out and not being not being afraid to
fail,” noting that early-career workers are often “more nervous
of looking bad and fail.” This hesitation, P2 explained, relates
to “a whole psychological aspect, but when someone feels good,
they have a healthy EQ.” Reflecting on a memorable candidate,
P2 shared that “what made her unique in those cases was she
would follow up, saying that because [she] didn’t know, here’s
what [she] would do to go find this.” This proactive mindset,
grounded in confidence, stood out even more as the candidate
“came across as somebody who was a solid thinker, brought
critical thinking skills and just had a confidence and calmness,”
which P2 found “really impressive for somebody of her age,”
and more typical of someone “from an executive in mid 50s.”

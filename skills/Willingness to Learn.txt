Willingness to Learn was consistently emphasized by
managers as an essential trait for early-career candidates
entering software and technical roles. P1 captured this ex-
pectation simply: “people who have learned and want to
continue learning as they go.” Managers explained that strong
candidates show a proactive, curious mindset, what P2 called
a commitment to “developing a growth mindset” and the
practice of “always be learning, always be looking for new
opportunities to learn,” including beyond just technical topics
into interpersonal and collaborative skills. Several highlighted
that willingness to learn is especially important when navigating
the unknown. As P3 noted, candidates who say, “I don’t know
something, but I’m willing to go learn it,” often stand out,
especially when paired with the self-awareness and initiative
to “figure out on their own the steps [they] have to take to be
a self-starter.” This aligns with P6’s view that for junior hires,
“the biggest thing you have... is ’I’m here to learn’” and that
a simple statement like “I don’t know that, but I’m willing
to learn” is often enough to earn a manager’s confidence.
Curiosity was also considered a core signal for willingness to
learn. P7 himslef sduring an interview, “does this candidate
have curiosity? Is this candidate inquisitive?” and celebrated
a past hire who “wasn’t afraid of tinkering” and became one
of their best team members. For many managers, the capacity
to learn quickly was more important than current knowledge.
P8 referred to this as “learnability, that ability to climb the
curve,” while P9 looked for whether candidates could “learn
and come up to speed quickly” and “continue to learn through
their career.” As P12 concluded, the goal is to “find somebody
who is happy to learn”, a quality that underpins long-term
growth, technical advancement, and sustained contribution in
evolving software environments.
